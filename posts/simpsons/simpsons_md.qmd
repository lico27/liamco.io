## Intro

I have officially undertaken my first data analysis project - looking at some Simpsons data for <a href='https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday' target='_blank'>#TidyTuesday</a>. I've been learning R for a grand total of two weeks so this is not particularly ✨ excellent ✨ (Mr Burns voice) but we all start somewhere!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
episodes <- read_csv("/Users/liamcottrell/codingStuff/data-projects/tidy-tuesdays/simpsons/simpsons_episodes.csv")
episodes_id <- episodes$id
```

## Overview

The dataset comprises the following attributes:

```{r}
# find the column titles
names(episodes)
```

There are `r nrow(episodes)` episodes in the dataset.

```{r}
# find the first and last episodes
first_ep <- episodes %>%
  filter(id == min(id)) %>%
  pull(title)

first_ep_year <- episodes %>%
  filter(id == min(id)) %>%
  pull(original_air_year)

last_ep <- episodes %>%
  filter(id == max(id)) %>%
  pull(title)

last_ep_year <- episodes %>%
  filter(id == max(id)) %>%
  pull(original_air_year)
```

The episodes range from Episode `r min(episodes_id)` ('`r first_ep`') in `r first_ep_year`, to Episode `r max(episodes_id)` ('`r last_ep`') in `r last_ep_year`.

## IMDb Ratings

### What is the highest rated episode of all time?

```{r}
# find highest IMDb ratings
highest_rated_one <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(title)

highest_rated_one_season <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(season)
  
highest_rated_two <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice(2) %>%
  pull(title)

highest_rated_two_season <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice(2) %>%
  pull(season)

highest_rating <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(imdb_rating)

```

Two episodes hold the honour of being highest rated: <em>`r highest_rated_one`</em> and <em>`r highest_rated_two`</em>, both from season `r highest_rated_two_season` and both scoring `r highest_rating`/10.

### What is the lowest rated episode of all time?

```{r}
# find lowest IMDb ratings
lowest_rated <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == min(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(title)

lowest_rated_season <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == min(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(season)

lowest_rating <- episodes %>%
  filter(imdb_rating == min(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(imdb_rating)
```

Season `r lowest_rated_season`'s <em>`r lowest_rated`</em>, with just `r lowest_rating`/10, is the lowest rated episode.

### IMDb ratings over time

```{r}
# plot ratings over time by season 
ggplot(episodes, aes(x = episodes_id, y = episodes$imdb_rating, color = factor(episodes$season))) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Episode Titles

```{r}
# find character names in episode titles
main_characters <- c("Homer", "Marge", "Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie")
name_counts <- sapply(main_characters, function(p) sum(grepl(p, episodes$title)))
name_freq <- data.frame(Name = names(name_counts), Count = name_counts)
```

### Whose name appears most in episode titles?

```{r}
# visualise frequency of character names appearing in episode titles
ggplot(name_freq, aes(x = Name, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal()

```
