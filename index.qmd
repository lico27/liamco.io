<p>Welcome to my portfolio! It's a work in progress currently, but please check back soon ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I've been an MSc Data Science student at <a href="https://uwe.ac.uk" target="_blank">UWE Bristol</a> since January 2025, and I'll be using this portfolio to keep track of my projects and learning.</p>

<p>I'm also a graduate of edX's Front-End Web Development bootcamp, which taught me fundamental skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.</p>

<p>Feel free to take a look at my recent projects, and don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
